## 1.1 What is a Scout?

For the autonomous sorting system to function essential data needs to be obtained by a robot, called the scout. The scout obtains data about the environment through scanning and mapping a floor with it's sensors. The gathered data consists of a digital map that will be (manually) transferred to every robot in the autonomous sorting system.
