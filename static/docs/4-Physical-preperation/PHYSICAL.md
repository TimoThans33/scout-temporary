## 4. Physical Preparation

A physical field for the scout to drive and map is determined through following the next steps:

-   Determine the field you would like the Scout to map for you.
-   Check the floor on imperfections and possible rubbish (fix and clean those if needed).
- Mark the 4 corners (e.g. with tape) and measure the dimensions of your determined field.
- Determine and mark the origin of this field (obstacles can **never** be on your main branch of your determined field! Try to locate the obstacles close to your main brach instead. By putting the obstacles closer to your main branch, the robot is less likely to bump into an obstacle accidentally).
- Measure the outlines of the field and the distance perpendicular to the each outline measured from the origin of your field (by this you also determine the values of the field corners). If possible, this can be done with a laser to measure the outlines of the field.
- Measure the locations of your obstacles in your field.
